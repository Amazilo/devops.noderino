# Noderino Fun App!

This is a node app with a bunch of environment variables you can customize to learn!

`DESIRED_PATH` - changes the path that the server listens to.
`PORT` - changes the port that the server listens to.
`NUMBER` - changes an arbitrary number that is given to the server.

Have fun! :rocket:
